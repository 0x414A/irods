This installation of a resource server is currently incomplete and
needs the following steps executed as the service account "eirods":

  sudo su - eirods

As the service account user, executing the following script will
prompt for necessary iRODS iCAT server information and then
populate your irods.config accordingly:

  ./packaging/setup_resource.sh

This will result in a running resource server with a default
resource named with your hostname concatenated with "Resource"
and a local vault in ~/eirods/iRODS/Vault.

Please consult the manual for further configuration details.
