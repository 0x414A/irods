This set of files can be used to create a Docker image of an iRODS iCAT server.
To create and instantiate the server, use the following instructions.

1. Locate the files in a single directory (known below as "path")..
2. Run "docker build -t [repo/tag] [path]"
3. Run 
 "docker run -h [hostname] -p [ssh redirect]:22 \ 
   [irods redirect]:1247 -t -i [repo/tag]"

Once running...
* You can ssh to the box with "ssh -p [ssh redirect] admin@localhost"
* The admin password is "admin"
* rods is the only iRODS user, with password "rods"
