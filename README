Benefits of iRODS:

- iRODS abstracts data services from data storage to facilitate executing
  services across heterogeneous, distributed storage systems.
- iRODS empowers data stewards by partitioning policies, rules, and
  services they develop from repository management.
- iRODS executes your data policies on your schedule.
- iRODS virtualizes data policy by separating data management policy
  enforcement from repository management.
