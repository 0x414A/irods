The tests in this directory have been designed to run with E-iRODS.  E-iRODS is owned by the eirods user and, therefore, the tests must be run by the eirods user.  The best way to work with this requirement is to run this test suite in a VM.

Recommended: A VirtualBox guest of Ubuntu 12.04.

########################################


To ease development, the following environment conventions were found useful:

#### VirtualBox - use the default NAT network interface for VM
# set up port forwarding to be able to see into the VM from host OS
# for ssh
VBoxManage modifyvm "Your_VM_Image_Name" --natpf1 "guestssh,tcp,,2222,,22"
# for www
VBoxManage modifyvm "Your_VM_Image_Name" --natpf1 "guestweb,tcp,,8080,,80"

#### connect to your VM from host OS terminal - removes copy/paste pain
ssh -Y -p 2222 trelvb@127.0.0.1


########################################


#### On the VM, build E-iRODS with coverage enabled, and install:
cd e-irods
sudo ./packaging/build.sh -c icat postgres
sudo dpkg -i linux-2.6-amd64/e-irods-3.0b2-linux-2.6-amd64.deb
sudo su - eirods


#### Install nose on VM
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-nose lcov apache2
sudo easy_install psutil
sudo mkdir /var/www/dev
sudo chown -R eirods:eirods /var/www/dev

#### Run the test suite as eirods:
cd /var/lib/e-irods/tests/pydevtest
# this command will generate a coverage report for the tests run and copy to /var/www/dev
time ./run_pydevtest_coverage.sh username [nose params]
# the resulting html should be visible from host OS
open http://127.0.0.1:8080/dev


#### Clean up (delete coverage directories and .pyc files):
./cleanup.sh
